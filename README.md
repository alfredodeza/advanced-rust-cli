# Rust CLI Example

A small Rust CLI example you can use to build on. With an emphasis on Linux and creating automation tools that solve a problem for you. This is the basis for DevOps principles that you can apply in your own environment as well as production environments for automating tasks and making your an efficient engineer.

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

ðŸ’¡ Are you just looking for a ðŸ‘‰ [Rust template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) to get started easily with a project? The [template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) has everything you need!

## Contents
This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

These are all the tools and editor extensions recommended for Python development:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)

### Lesson 1: Developing comples Command-line tools
- [Adding Sub-commands]()

- [Adding environment variables]()

### Lesson 2: Packaging and distributing your tool
- [Creating a Package]()

### Lesson 3: Logging and error handling strategies
- [Basic Logging]()

- [Handling errors]()
  
### Lesson 4: Practice Lab
Use the [included practice lab](./lab.md) to apply the content you've learned in this week. Follow the steps to create your own repository and apply the requirements to complete the lab.

## Course recommendations
This repository and video course focuses on the development side of command-line tools in Rust. It uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) as the editor of choice. You can use any editor you like, but the instructions in this repository will be for VS Code.

These are all the tools and editor extensions I recommend you install to get started:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [Rust and Cargo tools](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)

As part of your development workflow, I highly suggest you use the following programs in the terminal regularly:

- `cargo fmt` - Formats your code to the Rust standard
- `cargo clippy` - Lints your code and helps you find errors and potential issues
- `cargo check` - Checks your code for errors and allows you to fix them before compiling (which means its faster!)
